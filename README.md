# MakerSpace
This repository is for the MS812 project of MIS Group 4 at the University of Galway. It is an information management system for the MakerSpace department of the university library. 

There are two platforms, which include the student platform and the admin platform. The student platform, which is open to the public, supports equipment reservation, workshop register, and online learning. The admin platform, which enables authentication and authorization, helps the manager to manage equipment and workshop, and provides data analysis.

The backend is built with Spring Boot While the frontend is developed based on React. The database is MySQL.
